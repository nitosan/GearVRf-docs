Tom Flynn's GearVRf session at SDC2016 ( https://www.samsungdevelopers.com/Samsung Developer Connection website) was an overview of the GearVR Framework, along with sample code and demos. Tom also presented live scripting in both JavaScript and Lua and taught the audience how to use the I/O subsystem, how to control objects in VR with the new 3D Cursor VR input model, and how to integrate a new I/O device.

In partnership, these companies have already been integrated into GVRf: The Eye Tribe's mobile VR eye tracking solution (Eye Tribe VR), Gestigon's touchless hand visualization and recognition/gesture SDK (Carnival AR/VR Interaction Suite), Manus' revolutionary, immersive, intuitive VR Gloves, and Ximmerse's Virtual Reality Input Solution that enables 6DOF tracking for Mobile VR.
